# BiDaR project 
Made by Bumbu Ana-Maria, Manolache Irinel, Manoleasa Tudor

# Description
There are plenty of interesting resources provided by various knowledge Web systems like Wikidata. Develop a (micro-)service-based platform able to "intelligently" query, compare, visualize, share, summarize, etc. large (sets of) data/knowledge and additional resources according to user's needs and preferences – consider demographic information, skills, interests (playing games and skateboarding versus WebAssembly programming and fine arts), social status, entourage, etc. 
Also, this Web system will suggest related information and/or knowledge according to each user profile and a set of given areas/topics of interest. Various computations could be performed by using existing big data techniques and tools. Expose minimum 2 real-life use-cases – for instance, discovering the fine arts, dance, or music (styles/artists/organizations) influences in the last Y years in a specific geographical area. Bonus: the use of natural user interactions.
